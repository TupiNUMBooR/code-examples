### A simple system of waves for my game

A wave is a `MonoBehaviour` that does some action when enabled and then disables itself.

- [DropWave](https://github.com/TupiNUMBooR/code-examples/blob/main/Waves/DropWave.cs) drops items
- [SpawnWave](https://github.com/TupiNUMBooR/code-examples/blob/main/Waves/SpawnWave.cs) spawns units
- [WaitWave](https://github.com/TupiNUMBooR/code-examples/blob/main/Waves/WaitWave.cs) waits some time
- [WaveSequence](https://github.com/TupiNUMBooR/code-examples/blob/main/Waves/WaveSequence.cs) executes the sequence of waves. It is a wave too, so I can unite waves in a tree-like structure.
